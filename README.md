# Tab-Organiser
As a first project, I have made a program that runs from the command line to organise tabs into a database.

If you're like me you probably use multiple google chrome tabs at once and it starts to slow down your computer and clutter your browsing experience.

I created this program for myself to keep my browsing organised. I'd be welcome to any suggested improvements!
